This demo was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

To test changes to lapidary change the version of lapidary in the demo's package.json file from `x.x.x` to `link..`
Run `yarn watch` from the top level directory to ensure all changes to lapidary trigger a rebuild of the package.
Run `yarn start` from the demo directory to view the demo in your browser.

## Deployment

From the top level directory run `bash publish-demo.sh`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
