### Configurable facet based filtering.

Heavily inspired by [Destiny Item Manager](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM)'s inventory search feature.

The idea is to basically just build a generic version of that.

## Why "Lapidary" though?

```
lapidary (noun): a person who cuts, polishes, or engraves gems.
```

The cuts on a gem are called facets. This library uses the word 'facet' to refer to any property of an item. It lets you 'cut' (filter) your data along any facets you want. :)

Oh and to continue the gem metaphor the logo color is the [hex for sapphire](https://www.colorhexa.com/0f52ba)
