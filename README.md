### Configurable facet based filtering.

Heavily inspired by [Destiny Item Manager](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM)'s inventory search feature.

The idea is to basically just build a generic version of that.

[Here is a work in progress demo](https://jbccollins.github.io/lapidary/demo/index.html)

This screenshot kinda shows some of the more advanced types of queries you can do with lapidary.
Right now I don't have documentation on what exactly is possible since so much is still in flux with the code.

At this point it's almost fully functional. I'd like to build a useful little input component around it to make it more approachable though.


## Why "Lapidary" though?

```
lapidary (noun): a person who cuts, polishes, or engraves gems.
```

The cuts on a gem are called facets. This library uses the word 'facet' to refer to any property of an item. It lets you 'cut' (filter) your data along any facets you want. :)

Oh and to continue the gem metaphor the logo color is the [hex for sapphire](https://www.colorhexa.com/0f52ba)
